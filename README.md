This computer science IA is called "EduTrack".

It has been coded in Java with Maven and it uses the SQLite database. Hence, to execute this code one must need a Java IDE (preferably Apache NetBeans) as well as SQLite from DB Browser.

The required dependencies can be seen in the pom.xml file. The JAR files for the dependencies must be downloaded and manually installed into the 'Dependencies' folder of the NetBeans project.

After all the applications and dependencies required to run the program have been downloaded, navigate to the 'source code' folder in 'Products' and create a NetBeans project. Copy paste each code as a Java class/JFrame into the NetBeans project created.

clsDB is a Java Class whereas all other files must be pasted as JFrames.

clsDB contains the main() function. Hence, to start the program, the clsDB file must be executed.
